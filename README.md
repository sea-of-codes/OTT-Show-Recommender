ðŸŽ¬ OTT Content Dashboard & Recommender

This project analyzes and recommends TV shows and movies from major OTT platforms â€” Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+. Using cleaned and merged datasets, it explores content trends across platforms through visualizations like pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and treemaps.

A content-based recommendation system is built using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. It includes:

recommend_show() â€“ suggests similar TV shows

recommend_movies() â€“ suggests similar movies

find_your_mind() â€“ a guided recommendation tool based on type, year, age, genres, and platform

ðŸ“Š The project includes multiple visualizations to understand content trends:

Bar chart for count and platform

Pie charts for genre and platform distribution

Line charts showing title counts over years

WordCloud visualizing the most frequent words in show descriptions or genres

The goal is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, analysis, machine learning, and storytelling through data. This project can be extended into a Streamlit dashboard or deployed online.

All data was sourced from Kaggle, and the project is organized for readability and future improvement. Ideal for learning, interviews, or showcasing your data science abilities.
